# Mirror Information
#####
This repository is a mirror of the Ubuntu ISOs located on the internet at:
http://mirror.us.leaseweb.net/ubuntu-releases

This mirror is designed to emulate releases.ubuntu.com.

# Retention Policy
####

We are excluding any and all files and directories with the exception of select iso files.
In particular, we are mirroring the *.iso files for the Xenial, Bionic (once avaiable) and latest.

We believe that this retention policy is sufficient for Ubuntu ISOs.
If you would like packages for an older/another version that is still hosted online,
please create a ticket on the JIRA service desk for the Unit Software License Manager (USLM).

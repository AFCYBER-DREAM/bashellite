# Mirror Information
#####

This repository is a mirror of the official pypi repo located on the internet at:
https://pypi.python.org


#####
# Retention Policy
####

We are currently mirroring all packages, all versions, with a few exceptions.

Some packages with names similar to common packages have been excluded for security reasons.

We believe that this retention policy is sufficient for our internal infrastructure needs, 
and should cover most developer use cases as well.

If you would like older python package versions that are still hosted online elsewhere,
please create a ticket on the JIRA service desk for the Unit Software License Manager (USLM).

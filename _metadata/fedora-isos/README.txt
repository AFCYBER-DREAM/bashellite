# Mirror Information
#####
This repository is a mirror of the Fedora ISOs located on the internet at:
http://mirrros.mit.edu

# Retention Policy
####

We are excluding any and all files and directories with the exception of select iso files.
In particular, we are mirroring the *.iso files for the latest two releases only.
Fedora ships in multiple variants, we are mirroring the ISOs for:
  - Fedora Everything NetInstall
  - Fedora Everything Workstation Live
  - Fedora Server DVD

Each of these is capable of using updates from the Everything repository.

We believe that this retention policy is sufficient for Fedora ISOs.
If you would like packages for an older/another version that is still hosted online,
please create a ticket on the JIRA service desk for the Unit Software License Manager (USLM).

# Mirror Information
#####
This repository is a mirror of the CentOS ISOs located on the internet at:
http://centos.mirror.lstn.net

This mirror is designed to emulate mirror.centos.org, with one important exception.
The official CentOS mirror does not host any ISO files. It refers users to a mirror list.
This source/upstream mirror is one of those mirrors and includes the ISO files.

#####
# Retention Policy
####

We are also excluding any and all files and directories with the exception of select iso files.
In particular, we are mirroring the *.iso files for CentOS 6 and 7 (latest only).

We believe that this retention policy is sufficient for CentOS ISOs.
If you would like packages for an older/another version that is still hosted online,
please create a ticket on the JIRA service desk for the Unit Software License Manager (USLM).

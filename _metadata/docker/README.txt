# Mirror Information
#####
This repository is a mirror of the latest Docker Community Edition clients located on the internet at:
http://download.docker.com

# Retention Policy
####

We are excluding all clients in the mac/ directory as well as excluding all architectures except for the x86_64 architecture, 
sources, and debugged versions of the clients.

We believe that this retention policy is sufficient for docker client files.
If you would like clients for an another architecture and/or source/debugged versions that is still hosted online,
please create a ticket on the JIRA service desk for the Unit Software License Manager (USLM).

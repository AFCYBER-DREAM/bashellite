# Mirror Information
#####
This repository is a mirror of the Debian "oldstable" release ISOs located on the internet at:
rsync://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/latest-oldstable/amd64/iso-dvd/
http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/latest-oldstable/amd64/iso-dvd/

# Retention Policy
####

We are also excluding any and all files and directories with the exception of select iso files.
In particular, we are mirroring only the amd64 architecture files, and only the DVD files..

We believe that this retention policy is sufficient for Debian ISOs.
If you would like ISOs for an older/another version that is still hosted online,
please create a ticket on the JIRA service desk for the Unit Software License Manager (USLM).
